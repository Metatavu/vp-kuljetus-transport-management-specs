        new vehicle with updated structure should be created. This updates the
        active vehicle for the truck and archives the previous one.

        Attempt to create new time entry should fail if:
          1) New time entry does not have endTime but there is already one time entry without endTime for the same employee. This is because time entries without endTime are considered to be running timers and only one is allowed at a time.
          2) If time new entry intersects with an existing time entry.

        Update should fail, when:

        2) If modifying the entry would lead it to intersect with another time entry.

            If an employee has an existing time entry without an end time and the new entry is missing end time,

            the new time entry should not be created and instead a bad request is to be returned.

            When a new entry is created with both start and end times, the existing entry is ignored.

          description: >
            Group number of the task. Gets a value of 0 by default. Can be
            updated from the management UI. All tasks with the same freightId,
            customerSiteId, type and group number are shown as grouped together
            in the driver app.
        orderNumber:
          type: integer
          description: >
            Order number of the task. Tasks have order numbers when being part
            of a route (having a routeId). Unallocated tasks (not having a
            routeId) do not have order numbers. When creating/updating a route
            with a routeId, the order number MUST also be in place. Negative
            order numbers are not allowed. If a number higher than the current
            amount of tasks in the route is used, it will be silently updated to
            be one higher than the current maximum. When either routeId or
            orderNumber is updated to a task, order numbers of other tasks with
            the same routeId are also updated accordingly. This means all of the
            tasks in a route should be reloaded when order number of a single
            task is updated. When updating a task to have an order number that
            already exists in the same route, the existing task is placed after
            the updated task. Tasks are also displayed as grouped, when they
            have the same routeId, customerSiteId, type and groupNumber. Order
            of tasks inside a group does not matter, so a new task added to the
            group will be the last task in the group. When order is updated, the
            grouping should be taken into account in order numbers. All of the
            grouped tasks should be next to each other. A task after the grouped
            tasks should have the next order number from the highest one of the
            group.
